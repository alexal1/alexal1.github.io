      <h1>Bitcoin Evolution</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The exact history of Bitcoin is written in BIPs – "Bitcoin improvement Proposals" and is stored in the <a
          href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">Bitcoin Github repo</a>. This article covers only the most significant
        moments of Bitcoin's evolution. Things that affect the community and the <i>market cap</i> most of all, are the
        forks. So, let's start with the important qustion.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>What are the different types of forks?</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Hard fork</strong> splits the blockchain into two branches with different protocols. After the hard
        fork you have same amount of money in both branches. But real value will most likely get distributed between
        them, because a split causes users migration and falling of the original branch's market cap.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Soft fork</strong> is a not necessary upgrade to the soft which runs the blockchain. You can ignore it
        if you like. Upgraded nodes will keep supporting your transactions.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Source Code fork</strong> is a way to create a completely different cryptocurrency. It is created by
        modifying the code of an existing cryptocurrency. The word "fork" here refers to the code forking in version
        control systems.</p>

          <h2>Genesis Block</h2>
          <p>Satoshi mined the first-ever Bitcoin block. It's called a "Genesis Block".</p>

          <h4>January 2009</h4>
          <h2>P2PKH addresses introduced</h2>
          <p>Only after a week after mining the first block, "Pay to Public Key Hash" transactions started to be used.
            They are a more secure replacement for P2PK, which is short for "Pay to Public Key", (no additional "Hash"
            for the public key).</p>
          <br>
          <p>P2PKH addresses always start with "1". Nowadays they are also called "legacy".</p>

          <h2>First GPU miner</h2>
          <p>The code was written and published to generate Bitcoins with a video card.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>October 2011</h4>
          <h2>[Source Code fork] Litecoin (LTC)</h2>
          <p>A new cryptocurrency invented which used "Scrypt" hashing function instead of SHA-256.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The idea was to make the proof-of-work more dependent on memory rather than on CPU power. It was meant to
            achieve more "democratic" mining opposed to Bitcoin, where large players with GPU-based farms started to
            appear.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, the initial idea failed, because some companies introduced ASICs (special machines) for Scrypt
            mining a few years later.</p>

          <h4>January 2012</h4>
          <h2>[Soft fork] P2SH and Multisig Addresses</h2>
          <p>Pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses were introduced. Previously a signature had to match sender's public
            address hash. After this update, it became possible to provide a hash of special "spending conditions", also
            called a "redeem script".</p>
          <br>
          <p>The most common usage for the redeem script is to encode the necessity of several keys to approve the
            transaction ("multi signature"). If part of the private keys are compromised, assets will still be secured.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>P2SH addresses always start with "3".</p>

          <h4>February 2012</h4>
          <h2>Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (HD) invented</h2>
          <p>Such wallets generate a bunch of private keys from your "extended" private key. For each private key a
            public key is generated as usual.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The benefits are:</p>
          <p>• Nobody knows exact amount of money you have, because your funds are distributed among several addresses.
          </p>
          <p>• If one of your private keys gets hacked, you won't loose all your funds.</p>

          <h4>December 2012</h4>
          <h2>First ASIC miner developed</h2>
          <p>ASIC is short for "application-specific integrated circuit". It is a hardware designed to do one thing and
            one thing only – mine cryptocurrency.</p>

          <h4>September 2013</h4>
          <h2>Mnemonic codes</h2>
          <p>An algorythm was proposed, which uses a list of English words to generate a "seed". Seed is a number used
            by pseudo-random values generators to generate a private key. By this way, a seed determines your private
            key.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The wallets using such approach are called "Deterministic Wallets" or "Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets"
            if they also use "extended" private key.</p>

          <h4>January 2017</h4>
          <h2>Lightning Network</h2>
          <p>Launch of the first Lightning Network implementation.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The idea was to open fast and cheap peer-to-peer payment channels between users. Bitcoin blockchain was
            supposed to get updated only after closing the channel and only with a single consolidated transaction.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However the technology is not working good enough right now due to technical and legal issues.</p>

          <h4>August 2017</h4>
          <h2>[Soft fork] Segregated Witness (SegWit)</h2>
          <p>The basic idea of SegWit was to store part of the data in the "sidechain". The data to be separated (or
            "segregated") to this separate chain was chosen to be signatures. Signatures (or "witness data") are part of
            each transaction and they take 65% of the space. The "sidechain" was implemented over the current blockchain
            via a "Mercle tree". Such implementation made it possible to keep backward compatibility to the old
            protocol.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The key improvements are:</p>
          <p>• Smaller transaction sizes => more transactions in a block</p>
          <p>• Fix for the "malleability issue" in Bitcoin. It is a security issue which allowed to fake "cancelled"
            transactions by editing signature data while transaction is in a queue.</p>
          <br>
          <p>SegWit addresses can be Native and based on P2SH.</p>
          <p>Former are also called bech32 or P2WPKH ("Pay to Witness Public Key Hash") and always start with "bc1".
            They are generally better, but were not widely supported at start.</p>
          <p>Latter are also called P2SH-P2WPKH and always start with "3" as well as all P2SH addresses.</p>

          <h2>[Hard fork] Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</h2>
          <p>Opposed to SegWit as a "continuation of Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision". Same protocol as before, but
            larger blocks. Faster, cheaper, but more centralized due to increased blockchain size.</p>

          <h2>[Hard fork] Bitcoin Gold (BTG)</h2>
          <p>Another attempt to create an "ASIC-resistant" cryptocurrency. Developers invented so-called "Equihash"
            memory intensive proof-of-work algorythm. However, an ASIC for this algorythm was created at least once
            already. Developers continue the fight by enrolling new updates.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador by President Nayib Bukele.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The experiment is considered failed. Bitcoin is too volatile and slow itself, so actually it was used as a
            guise for promoting a government-backed app called Chivo. Which turned to be a centralized service with lots
            of security holes.</p>
